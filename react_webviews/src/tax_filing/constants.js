You can claim tax refunds by filing your income tax return. Once ITR is filed, any excess tax will be refunded to your bank account as mentioned in the ITR. 

Which income tax return (ITR) should I select for e-filing?
There are 7 different forms (ITR 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) to suit different tax situations. Since, most might not be aware of which form to choose, our e-filing system automatically decides for you based on your details. 

My company deducts TDS. Do I still have to file my income tax return (ITR)?
Yes, deducting TDS and filing an ITR are two different things. ITR is filed to show that you've paid the tax required to pay in the given financial year. 

Note: The ITR is also a very useful document when it comes to applying for a loan or visa.

You can still file your tax return without Form 16. You just have to enter your basic and income details.
